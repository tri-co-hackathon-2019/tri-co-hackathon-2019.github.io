## THE EVENT

The Tri-Co Hackathon aims to bring teams of students from Haverford, Swarthmore, and Bryn Mawr together in collaborative learning through engagement with digital technology and programming. This year, the event will be in Sci 101 in the Science Center at Swarthmore College.

## ABOUT

After workshops and dinner, students will meet and discuss interests and project ideas around proposed themes to form teams of 2-5 people. Teams work together on a prototype until 6pm on Saturday evening when they will present their work to a panel of judges for a chance to win prizes. 

## EXPERIENCE

No experience necessary! This event is for all students -  from coding neophytes to seasoned Computer Science majors.  

There will be a selection of skill-building workshops on Friday afternoon to help beginners learn concept and tools to help get their projects up and running, as well as more advanced topics for those with experience interested in learning something new. 

## SUGGESTED PROJECT THEMES

These are some suggested themes to help inspire projects but students/teams can choose other topics as well. 

### Urban Data 

With the rise of open data initiatives, cities around the world are inviting their residents to participate in the challenging and exciting issues of 21st networked urban environments through exploring, connecting and creating data. How can data tell stories? How can it connect residents? How can it reveal opportunities for change? How can it contribute to a higher quality of living for all?

### Sustainability 

How can creativity and a bit of code contribute to issues of environmental justice and sustainability, locally and beyond? Whether through education or transparency, networking or advocacy, consider how projects can make inroads into specific real-world problems facing a fast-changing Earth.

### Resistance 

From social media to information clearinghouses to data journalism, networked digital technology has changed the face of political advocacy. From twitterbots to aggregators of topical content, from automating how we contact representatives to disseminating information across networks to secure communications where internet access is restricted or surveilled -- technology has had an enormous impact on how citizens engage in civil society.

### Social Change 

What is an area of concern you want to address? How can one use networks, information, and/or actions to influence social change? Is your focus at a local or global level?

### Strengthening the Tri-Co 

What solutions might there to help create stronger connections, exchanges, and idea-sharing across the tri-co?  Are there ways the schools might work together towards a common goal, share resources or information? What solutions are already in place that can be improved or completely re-imagined to benefit student groups, individuals, or all three schools as a whole?
